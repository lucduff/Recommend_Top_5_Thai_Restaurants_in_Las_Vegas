This directory serves as a repository for background information on the project and for the delivery of a summary of the analysis. For a more detailed account of the results, please check the Jupyter Notebooks under the 'recommender-models' directory. They not only provide code, but also results, observations and conclusions for various elements of the analysis.

NOTE: A jpg file of the project flow diagram from the paper is provided in case the delivery of the diagram did not work out in the conversion.
